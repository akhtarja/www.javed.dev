# www.javed.dev

[![Dependabot Status](https://api.dependabot.com/badges/status?host=github&repo=akhtarja/www.javed.dev)](https://dependabot.com)

This repository contains the codebase for https://www.javed.dev.

The Gulp build process places the final assets into the /build folder. The serverless deployment process creates an S3 bucket called `www.javed.dev` to hold the assets. This can be changed by editing the value of `APP_BUCKET_NAME` in `app/serverless.yml`.

## Deploying the Back End
1. Clone this repo.

2. Create an AWS IAM user with programmatic access. Add the keys to your local AWS credential files using the name `www-javed-dev`.

3. The application expects the following environment variables:

| Variable name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `WWW_JAVED_DEV_SPOTIFY_NOW_PLAYING_URL_[dev/staging/prod]` | The URL of the Spotify Now Playing API endpoint |
| `WWW_JAVED_DEV_SPOTIFY_NOW_PLAYING_KEY_[dev/staging/prod]` | The API key for use with the Spotify Now Playing endpoint |
| `WWW_JAVED_DEV_NOWPLAYING_API_CUSTOM_URL_[dev/staging/prod]` | The absolute root URL of a custom now playing endpoint URL, if desired. If this is left blank, the API endpoint URL will be automatically generated by AWS |

4. Deploy the `now-playing` service. From the project's root:
```
cd now-playing
npm install
serverless deploy [--stage dev|staging|prod]
```

## Building the Front End
Build the application front end. Go back to the project's root and do the following for a **development environment**:
```
cd app
npm install
npm run start
```
This will run the application in a local development server at `localhost:3000`. To create an optimized production build, run `npm run build`. The compiled assets will be created in the `build` folder.
